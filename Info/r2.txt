Blind Mode -
This mode is like Tic Tac Toe, with a 5x5 board, but blind. 
Player 1 is X and player 2 is O, players play turn by turn.
A player chooses his desired spot by clicking on it, and if the spot is taken, he has to retry.
When the user chooses his spot however, the board will not update.
A player wins when he connects 4 of his symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The match is tied when there is no remaining move left.
The board updates to show the arrangement when a person wins, or it's a tie.
