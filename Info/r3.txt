Phantom Mode -
This mode is like Tic Tac Toe, with a 5x5 board, but with a twist. 
Player 1 is X and player 2 is O, players play turn by turn.
A player chooses his desired spot by clicking on it, and if the spot is taken, he has to retry.
The twist is, that when the user chooses his desired spot, 
the board will show random configurations, changing with each turn.
A player wins when he connects 4 of his symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The match is tied when there is no remaining move left.
The board updates to show the real arrangement when a person wins, or it's a tie.
